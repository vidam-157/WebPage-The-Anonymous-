They offer you free speech yet they censor your voice. WAKE UP!" Furthermore, the page’s title changed to read: ‘The problem with politicians is they lie’ – a play on the party’s own message, that politicians talk too much and listen too little. Later the party confirmed that the details of 2,000 people who had the connection with the website had been compromised by the attack.</p>
