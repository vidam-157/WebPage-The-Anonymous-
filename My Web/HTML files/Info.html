						<p>Anonymous, "The eyes of the blind, the sound of the deaf, voice of the silence and the protectors of the innocent." is a hacktivist/activist group of people on the internet who fight for the justice of every citizen of the world. Their name "Anonymous" means hide the identity from others, as how they exactly do. No one knows how many anonymous members associated with the group. They don’t have a boss who controls them. If someone wants to join us it’s your choice. You’re in or out it depends upon you. Whenever do you want to come and whenever you want to go it’s your choice no one will force you. They are masking their faces and the vocals are changed when they reveal to the external world.</p>

					<h2>The Origin</h2>

					<p> The anonymous group was originated in the image sharing platform called "4chan" in 2003.

					<h2>The Group</h2>

					<p> The hacktivist group finds solutions for the unanswered political and social problems that always suffers and dominates the innocent public. Simply the anonymous group is an internet-based, non-extremist, socialist community movement that looks for answers to questions that are unanswered. Because anonymous doesn’t have a leadership, there is no any restrictions for being a member of the group or conducting activities. But the group is well-known about their ultimate goal and well-organized during an attack. </p>
					<br>

					<p> The group standing on their own policy of justice for the oppressed has been carried out <a href="Activity.html" style="color:black;">attacks</a> even against such powerful parties as U.S. government agencies as FBI, media, companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers. These attacks against the world highly secured systems proves the talent and the power of Anonymous. The group's activity resulted in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities. They are blacklisted by these agencies and the law, but for the whole world as common "The Anonymous" are real world heroes. In 2012 the "Time" magazine included anonymous to the top 100 of most influential people in the world.</p>
